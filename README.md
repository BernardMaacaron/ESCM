# ERO-SNN

Welcome to the ERO-SNN project!

## Introduction

ERO-SNN is a software library for implementing Event-Driven Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) using [Brian2](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). It provides a flexible and efficient framework for simulating and training spiking cortical models using event-based data.

## Features

- Event-driven simulation of spiking cortical models
- Support for various neuron and synapse models
- Flexible connectivity patterns
- Training algorithms for SNNs
- Visualization tools for analyzing network dynamics
